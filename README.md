# NeuralNetworksPeptides
Our neural networks for  peptides and protein sequences.
This project is a enhanced version of the original NeuralNetworksPeptides project.
This code focuses on training datasets generated by the bio-embeddings-encoding project.

# Installation
Is recommended to use a conda environment to install the required packages. To create a conda environment with the required packages, run the following command:
```bash
conda create -n NeuralNetworksPeptides python
conda activate NeuralNetworksPeptides
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
To use the neural networks, you can use the following command:
```bash
./train_w_raw_data.sh <path_to_raw_data> <path_to_seed>
```
Where:
- `<path_to_raw_data>` is the path to the raw data file.
- `<path_to_seed>` is the path to the seed file.

Example usage:
```bash
./train_w_raw_data.sh ../bio-embeddings-encoding/data seed
```
